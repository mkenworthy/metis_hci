# ELT pupils used for APP generation

Brunella Carlomagno, Emiel Por, David Doelman

The dimensions are:

  * R_outer=37m
  * R_inner=11.1m
  * Spider_width=0.60m


The pupils have the hexagonal primary mirror (M1) geometry
The M1 mirror is masked by a METIS cold stop, which is represented by the inner diameter 11.1m and outer diameter 37m.
The ELT secondary support spiders are approximated with six straight sided radial struts.

There are 4 pupils: 2 of 243px (one with segments and one binary) and 2 of 1024px (again, one with segments and one binary). Note that these pupils are not perfectly centered.

# Doelman and Por pupil for APP design

Emiel and I generated our own pupils which match the ones from Brunella.

There is an image of the difference of the two pupils, which is calculated in the attached code.
